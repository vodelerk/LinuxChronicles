Determine What Options Should Be Used with the `ssh` Command

View the man page for the ssh command, and determine the option to use to disable host key checking.
man ssh
The syntax to use is:
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@host


Build a Script from the Required Commands

Create a bin folder in cloud_user's home directory.
mkdir bin
Use vim or nano to create the file lab.sh in the new bin folder.
vim bin/lab.sh
Start with the shebang at the top of the file.
#!/bin/bash
Add a line to set a variable for the login user.
login_user=cloud_user
Add a line to ssh using the variable from above and taking the first parameter as the host address.
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no $login_user@$1
The completed script should look like this:
#!/bin/bash
login_user=cloud_user
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no $login_user@$1
check_circle
Execute and Verify the Script

check_circle
Add the New `bin` Directory to the `PATH` Variable

Execute and Verify the Script

Save the file, and make it executable.
chmod u+x bin/lab.sh
Run the script, passing 10.0.1.10 as the first parameter to be assigned to $1.
./bin/lab.sh 10.0.1.10
It should immediately prompt for cloud_user's password and not prompt for RSA fingerprint acceptance.




Add the New `bin` Directory to the `PATH` Variable

Append to the .bashrc file in cloud_user's home directory to add the new bin folder to the PATH environment variable.
echo 'PATH="$HOME/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> .bashrc
Source .bashrc to pick up the change.
source .bashrc
Verify that you can run lab.sh without specifying the path to the script.
lab.sh 10.0.1.10
