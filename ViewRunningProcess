Determine How Many Processes Are Currently Running

Run the following command:
ps aux | grep -v grep | wc -l


Determine the Current System Load

Run one of the following commands:
uptime
cat /proc/loadavg
top


Determine How Many Processes Are Running as `cloud_user`

Run one of the following commands:
ps -u cloud_user | wc -l
ps aux | grep -v grep | grep -E "^cloud" | wc -l



Determine the PID of the `xfce4-session` Process

Run the following command:
ps aux | grep xfce4-session | grep -v grep



Determine How Many Threads the `xfce4-session` Process Is Using

Determine the PID:
ps aux | grep xfce4-session | grep -v grep
View the current threads reported in the PID's status:
cat /proc/PROCESS_PID/status | grep Threads



Write a Small Shell Script that Returns the Number of Threads in a Process

Create a new file named /home/cloud_user/bin/threads.sh, and add the following script:

 #!/bin/bash

 if [ -n $1 ]
 then
   _pid=$(ps aux | grep -E "$1\$" | grep -v grep | grep -v threads.sh | awk '{print $2}')
   cat /proc/$_pid/status | grep Threads
 fi
