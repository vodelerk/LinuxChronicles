Create a Normal Archive

Use the following command to create a tarball of the ~/Practice folder named archive.tar:
tar cvf archive.tar Practice/


Create a Compressed Archive

Now create another tarball, but this time, compress it during creation with the following command:
tar czf archive.tgz Practice/


Compress the Normal Archive

Use the gzip utility to compress the first tarball (archive.tar) with maximum compression:
gzip -9 archive.tar
This will compress the file and rename it archive.tar.gz.



Extract the File `Practice/Test/version.txt` from `archive.tar.gz`

Use the following command to extract the file Practice/Test/version.txt from the compressed archive archive.tar.gz:
tar xzf archive.tar.gz Practice/Test/version.txt
This will extract the file to the existing path and overwrite the file if it exists.
